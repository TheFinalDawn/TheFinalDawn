Disclaimer: The above card only reads my github projects, and not the various things I have worked on but not published on github specifically.

Languages I know (somewhat ordered by experience):
* JS/Node (I use this for more than I should)
* HTML/CSS (note this is independent from designer skill)
* Python
* Java (makes me go :D)
* C#
* C++ (hardly any knowledge)

Bash, CMD, Git, and similar niche commandline languages should be put in their own category though.
